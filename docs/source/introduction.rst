Introduction
************


Storing static files inside compute system, involve some work when you decide to scale horizontally, but having all static files stored in a cloud object storage service (as a external "microservice") could ease the deployment process, in same time reducing the complexity and improving performance of the system.
You can check :ref:`some application architectures <extension/architecture>`.

For example:
    * storing CMS media files directly in a cloud object storage (like Amazon S3 or Azure Files) without touching server disk could be achieved with little effort :ref:`explained here <cms>`.
    * all files that are served raw could easily be served directly form there or through a built-in or third party CDN.
    * products media files could also be stored in a cloud object storage, but in this case the resized images could be served through a reverse proxy server with fallback resize endpoint.
    * even better you can extract image resizing feature as a microservice and reduce Magento complexity.

There are plenty of cloud static files storage services offered with various features, and most of them have same basic ideas:

    * allow secure upload remotely of files
    * deliver static file public or privately
    * built in Content delivery network (CDN)

With this idea in mind you can identify some advantages for using it in e-commerce websites for storing images and video for products, categories or CMS pages. Storing private content like downloadable products could be also covered.

Use cases
=========

Extracting static files storage component as a mictoservice
-----------------------------------------------------------

Having microservice responsible for storage of all static content and delivery is a happy case that allow developers focus on scaling independently compute and storage systems.

On premises deployment with cloud file storage and CDN in cloud
---------------------------------------------------------------

Even if this is not the lucky case this module could be used for this use-case, but some latency problems may occur on admin panel.

Store media files using remote cloud services, process images on application server.

  :alt: On premises deployment

.. note::
    Optimization could be achieved if resize script could be moved in same data-center with media storage service.

Migration to cloud from on premises infrastructure
--------------------------------------------------

In migration stage this module could be used as a way to migrate media files to cloud storage service.

  :alt: Migration to cloud

Already using cloud other services
----------------------------------

.. note::
    All notes above apply to this case, and the advantage of having the storage system and computing ones in same data-center will assure best performance and const-effective setup.


Features
========

Product file storage
--------------------

Images in gallery, product description images, or other product related photos will be stored at upload time in cloud and delivered from there each time is needed in frontend.

Downloadable products attachments are supported by installing Bb_StorageDownloadable.

Nothing changes in database architecture and the way Magento save path to product images.

Photo upload and management in admin
------------------------------------

The extension implements cloud storage folders navigation for admin user in order to allow user to locate directly on cloud needed images and insert into HTML without needs to be on applications servers.

WYSIWYG images storage
----------------------

In this area images are stored in cloud, and serve directly from there without processing or resizing.

:term:`OOB` See image bellow, to prove nothing change in the way content is saved. Url is still saved as relative path to media directory.

Sync command between filesystems
---------------------------------

For migration projects there is a command to synchronize media files from one filesystem to another.


.. code-block:: shell

    bin/magento bb:storage:sync

    Description:
      Sync media files between two filesystems on a particular directory.

    Usage:
      bb:storage:sync [options] [--] <source> <destination> [<directory>]

    Arguments:
      source                Origin filesystem code
      destination           Destination filesystem code
      directory             Directory to be synchronized.

    Options:
      -o, --overwrite       Overwrite files in destination

Report differences between filesystems
--------------------------------------

:term:`future work`

Also for later use there is a developer command to report the differences between two filesystems in order to re-evaluate migration process.


.. code-block:: shell

    bin/magento bb:storage:diff files s3 media

    Description:
      Create a report with differences between different two filesystems on a particular directory.

    Usage:
      bb:storage:diff <filesystem_1> <filesystem_2> <directory>

    Arguments:
      filesystem_1          First filesystem code
      filesystem_2          Second filesystem code
      directory             Directory to be compared


Multiple cloud buckets mapping for each sub-directory
------------------------------------------------------

Having multiple cloud objects buckets mapped to different media level directories allow website to expose files with different level of permission for frontend. For example for downloadable products, files should always be served through application server.

    .. _known_issues:

Known issues
============

Overwriting Magento media (or other core directory) location may cause some errors in modules (including Magento Core modules) not consistently using \\Magento\\Framework\\Filesystem for directory and files operations.

In some cases operations on files or directories are performed directly with php functions, or \\Magento\\Framework\\Filesystem\\DriverInterface objects are obtained directly from ObjectManager. Obtaining a driver object form filesystem object will avoid this type of problems.

Most of inconsistencies from Magento core are fixed in Bb_StorageCms, Bb_StorageCatalog, Bb_StorageDownloadable modules, and is part of the plan to include this improvements in Magento Community project.

However overwriting Magento core directories is not mandatory, because you can configure new directories for custom implementation with the base module Bb_Storage ant the module implementing the driver of your choice eg: Bb_StorageS3.

This module is not yet compatible with New Magento Media Gallery.

Latest releases
===============

.. note::

    This extension is currently a active development phase, check :ref:`Project Roadmap <roadmap>` to see some ideas or ask for solution on a particular use case.

    1.0.0 - proof of concept
          - Bb_Storage could be installed independently and will allow custom/new directories for new modules
          - To overwrite Magento storage following modules should be installed (are dependent on each-other for now): Bb_StorageOverwrite, Bb_StorageCms, Bb_StorageCatalog, Bb_StorageDownloadable
          - For now, When you create a mapping for a subdirectory, you need to create configuration for all others subdirectories
          - Available driver Bb_StorageS3 for Amazon S3 like integration. More drivers will be published soon depending on demands. Please request new drivers `on github <https://github.com/georgebabarus/magento-filesystem-extension/issues>`_.
