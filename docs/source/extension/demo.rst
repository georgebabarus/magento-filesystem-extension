Backend
==============================

Speaking about website management panel, the way admin user will interact with website will not be changed, in any meaner:

* no other request will be made then the Magento core ones
* no extra data is transferred to server, or stored in database
* no synchronization needed beside the first setup synchronization
* no duplicate media files will be saved once application si successfully configured

:term:`NEXT_MINOR_RELEASE`
Even if the extension will be configured by environment configuration there is a monitoring panel in admin, where admin users can perform basic checks of configuration setup and visualize statistics about the setup.


Frontend
==============================

Images delivery
---------------

As already discussed, with this modules we manage two types of images:

* resized/processed images that should be delivered using a proxy that can grab the original version of image process it, save the result into storage service for later use and return

    * if debug mode is configured in proxy configuration, you can see that the request goes to actual needed image from cloud

* raw images delivered without any processing and can be delivered by public link of the storage service.

CDN delivery
------------

No meter the case you are in, the solution can always contain a CDN (content delivery network) to optimize the download speed and even more avoid hitting the website infrastructure.

Extension in action
====================

Bellow you can see a test setup that will prove versatility of this extensions group.

You will find all key features explained during this documentation in few images, to better understand the use case.

Keep in mind that during this demo session the local disk of application server is never touched in media directory, all files are stored in configured storage service:

    * products images and cms pages and blocks images are stored in local Minio storage service
    * downloadable products attachments are stored in Amazon S3, private bucket


Catalog product image
---------------------

Update catalog product image directly in Minio - compatible with S3 API  media storage service.
