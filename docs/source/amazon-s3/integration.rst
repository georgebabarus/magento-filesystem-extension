S3 Driver Extension for Magento 2
=================================

Integrating the Amazon S3 filesystem in Magento is available by installing the package bb/filesystem-s3 containing the module named Bb_FilesystemS3.

Note that this module depends on the main module bb/filesystem (at an additional cost) to be able to properly configure the connection and define new directories or mapping existing directories.

The package depends on aws/aws-sdk-php: 3.x and bb/filesystem: 1.x, so, if you install it from the source you also need to install those package.

After installation follows the general configuration process :ref:`available here<configuration>`.
