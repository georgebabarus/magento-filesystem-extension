Roadmap

.. glossary::

    v1.1.0 - 1 November 2020
        * break dependency on Catalog, Cms and Downloadable modules in order to allow independent installation and usage.
            * most probably the media directory will be separated by the type of the module using it
            * multiple frontend urls based on media storage of subdirectory
            * avoid forcing usage of just one media storage for Catalog and Cms components

    v1.2.0 - 1 December 2020
        * integrate all Magento core refactoring and fixes into Magento Community project. Here we are talking mainly of placed where local filesystem is taken as granted, and php file management functions are called to execute actions that are already implemented in Magento Drivers.
