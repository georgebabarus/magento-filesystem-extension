        * publish Bb_StorageOverwrites the module in charge of mapping existing directories in Magento to Remote file systems
        * break the dependency between Bb_StorageCatalog, Bb_StorageCms and Bb_StorageDownloadable modules in order to allow independent installation and usage.

            * most probably the media directory will be separated by the type of the module using it
            * multiple frontend URLs based on media storage of subdirectory
            * avoid forcing usage of just one media storage for Catalog and Cms components
